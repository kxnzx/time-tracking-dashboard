### What I learned

I have learned how to add custom data to a <button> element with the data-\* attribute.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<!-- Data-* attribute attaches data to the button -->
<button data-frequency="daily" class="btn">Daily</button>
<button data-frequency="weekly" class="btn">Weekly</button>
<button data-frequency="monthly" class="btn">Monthly</button>
```
