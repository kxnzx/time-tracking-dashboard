## My process

**\*\***\*\*\***\*\*** JAVASCRIPT IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION **\*\***\*\*\***\*\***

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using data-\*

The data-\* attribute adds custom information to a <button> element.

- The \* part is replaced with a lowercase string, such as data-id, data-type, data-inventory, etc.

- A <button> element can have any number of data-\* attributes, each with their own name.

- Using data-\* attributes reduces the need for requests to the server.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
